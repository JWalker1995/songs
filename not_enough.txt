Not enough

I hold the stars in my hand,
Painted the sky, wove the rain.

Nations before have tried to stand,
I threw them down, had them slain.

But all the power, glory, might,
I'd throw it all away.

I'd let the stars fall from the sky,
Let me hold your heart today.

I'm gazing through all I possess,
Yearning to see you look at me.




Should I reach down, and prod your life?
Give you joy, or your heart's desire?

If I do it again, surely this time you'll see,
How much I desire you fall in love with me.
