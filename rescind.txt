And one day I'll arise,
See my God's light now shines,
Driving dark clouds,
Opening glorious skies.

And my Savior, my King,
Descends on radiant wings,
As I run to his arms,
His voice whispers to me.

Oh my child, come home,
I've so much to tell you,
But for now just fall into my arms,
And be close.



One day my God will rescind,
I'll hear his whispers again,
And he'll roll back the clouds,
That descend with my sin.
