Eyes of this blind man no longer closed,
Averted with horror from a world sin disposed.

The love/ that I lost/ whispering/ through the lies,
Keep/ crawling towards/ me, look into/ my eyes.
But I look/ back and die/ until I/ am revived,
Why are/ you so far/, won't you come/ walk beside?

But drag me in deeper, till I long to see light.
Let my suffering sing the song that my tongue tried to tell.

But this thunder keeps the time,
'til you conclude this perfect rhyme.
Each time the lightning splits the skies,
The air's dominion slowly dies.
When this cloud finally touches earth,
Planet two will have its birth.
Live will few and more will die,
I'll be in love with you inside.
