The loneliness that you contain,
Are droplets from God's heart.
Throughout time he's felt the same,
Watching his masterpiece fall apart.

Meaningless, vanity, such insanity,
Is the life I live to chase.
I'm an empty shell, an arid well,
Will I always feel the same?

I've tried to fill, feel something real,
But I come short, and can't ignore.

This hollow shell of me.
But I'm a mess, and scared to death,


On the day I die, will my savior cry,
Or welcome his son home?


The life I see looking back at me,
Taunting me the tried.




Meaninless, vanity, such insanity,
Are lives without a soul.
Spirits dwell in hollow shells,
Who think they have control.

Meaninless, vanity, such insanity,
What is it you see?
Spirits dwell in your hollow shell,
From whom will they be?
