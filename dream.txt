Is this you or just a dream,
A life to come or life to be.
A sharpened sword or just a voice,
Promising what cannot be?

I lay my burdens at your feet,
But you give them back to me.
I try to run but can't break free,
Of the world surrounding me.

My God, my God, to hear you speak,
Would make me give up everything.
Maybe that's why it cannot be,
A life of ease cannot be free.
