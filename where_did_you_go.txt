I used to feel your prescence reaching from the sky,
Bringing life to light and darkness slowly die.
Speaking comfort and soft whispers in my mind,
But today I call and all I hear are mine.

Where did you go?
My heart's request:
To see you and to join you in your rest.

Just glance at me.
My heart is just.
Lord but I will soon be lain into the dust.

And you will search,
For one you abhor,
You will search for me but I will be no more.

Why did you leave?
My heart's desire:
For your glory come and light my heart on fire.

5      4    2   0
I will wait for you.
Til you rescind.
5   5   4    3    45    6    7   6    5  4   3
One day I'll hear again your whispers on the wind.

And I'll fall down,
Before my king.
And I'll scream this song you've taught me how to sing.

Where had you gone?
What did I see?
The entire time you were walking next to me.
