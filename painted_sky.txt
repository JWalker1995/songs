Oh my child, don't you know,
That I've always loved you so,
A love so deep and wild and free it's killing me,
To helplessly watch you go.

About your business, late at night,
Rise up early, catch a flight,
On the plane nothing to do, so you sit back and take a snooze,
Flying through my painted sky.

If you'd only look outside,
You would see how much I tried,
To paint a picture, draw a scene, that'd make you fall in love with me,
But yet you turn your eyes.

If you could only hear my cries,
Shut your ears and close your eyes,
Turn from this pain that you have made, follow me and let me save,
Then perhaps you'll realize.

That I'm screaming out to you,
There's nothing more I want to do,
Than fill your vision, let you see, of all I created you to be,
And of the plan I've set for you.

If you'd only look outside,
You would see how much I tried,
To paint a picture, draw a scene, that'd make you fall in love with me,
But yet you turn your eyes.

I watch you groping in the dark,
Come see my spirit holds a spark,
On its own it can't do much, but if you dare enough to touch,
On this world you'll leave my mark.

Child know how loved you are,
I've planned it all out from the start,
You bless me and I'll bless you, show you exactly what to do,
Just fall in love with all your heart.

If you'd only look outside,
You would see how much I tried,
To paint a picture, draw a scene, that'd make you fall in love with me,
But yet you turn your eyes.
