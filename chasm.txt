After all that you've allowed,
My soul longs to feel you near.
God why must faith be how,
I know that you are here?

Just to hear you softly wisper,
I'd give up ten thousand dreams.
How can I bridge this fissure,
Separating you and me?

If demons settled in my soul,
Then perhaps you'd have ignored.
