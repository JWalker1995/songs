Why'm I falling asleep, falling asleep,
When there's so much here to keep me awake.
I'm drained by my tears, worn out by my fears,
Everything that I do becomes such a mistake. / The snake in the garden's softly hissing I break.


Black clouds though it's day as the light dies away,
I don't really care as I gaze at the ground.
What a beautiful leaf, so green and pristine,
Not like the other dead leaves lying around.

Heap up the earth, build it a berth,
Place it down gently and whisper a prayer.
The breeze gives a flutter but I'm lost in wonder,
Entranced by this breathtaking prince of the air.

But the wind's growing stronger, and shadows are longer,
My heart breaks as my butterfly almost flutters away.
Soon some twigs are a temple, and placing down gently,
Here's where my leaflet will forever stay.

As I lay down beside, transfixed and gazing inside,
The sky screams and trees start to groan.
Captivated by my life's prize, I cannot realize,
My life is no longer bla bla bla my own.





I didn't die so you could sleep your life away.
