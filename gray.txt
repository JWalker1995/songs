My King, He stands,
As dreams unfold,
He waits and beckons me to push a little more.

The colors fade,
To black and gray,
Once more I weep inside the chains that I have made.

I close my eyes,
My breathing slows,
I long to hold Him tight and never let Him go.

And I weep,
For He is there,
But I've strayed so far from home I've lost my way.

I cry out,
But no one's listening,
No one's there to hear me scream as I break down.
