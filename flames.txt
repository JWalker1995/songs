An army has been created
A champion's come alive.
The victory that was fated,
Fulfilled as the father cried.

Why do you sit silent,
As heaven screams your name?
You've only got this moment,
To save a soul from flame.

Do you hear the cries,
Of your champion on the cross?
Dying for the lives,
You saw and watched and lost.

If only we could see,
Oh to feel the heart of Christ.
Be completely overcome,
Gazing into sinners' eyes.

O watchman on the wall,
See the sword and sound your horn.
Scream until they hear your call,
Lest they fall unwarned.

Sleep and see slain's blood,
Heaped heavy upon your head.
How will you bear your guilt,
As millions now lie dead?

Save yourself and raise your voice,
O trumpet of the Great.
Let the people make their choice,
Don't join them in their fate.
