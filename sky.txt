I chased my dreams and laid them down,
Let love die and hope be found,
At world's end I found my peace in you.

As I float across the sea,
I realize all your majesty,
Was given so that I migt someday sing.

My heart takes flight into the skies,
And as I wake I realize,
That I'm in the presence of my king.

Beyond the bonds of space and time,

Man and matter fade away,
And I'm left with naught to say,
But "My King, how I love you".

He is brilliant like the sun,
I can't help but cry and run,
For a moment wrap Him in my arms.
