Your beauty transcends space and time,
The way your universe aligns,
Brings tears into your little child's eyes.

I gaze at galaxies and see,
Your quietness and harmony,


The light that shines into my eyes,
Was
Your words were written, every line,
To draw me deeper, covered by your love.
// To bring me slightly closer to your heart.

Our hearts yearn to feel more of you,
Look at the stars, know what went through,
Your mind as you spoke, giving each its name.

And I ask why?
For me.
